//! # sbus-rs
//!
//! A no_std compatible library for parsing SBUS (Serial Bus) protocol, commonly used in RC (Radio Control) systems.
//! SBUS is a protocol developed by Futaba for RC receivers to communicate with flight controllers and other devices.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `blocking`: Enables blocking I/O operations (enabled by default)
//! - `async`: Enables async I/O operations
//! - `std`: Enables standard library features
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use sbus_rs::{SbusParser, SbusPacket};
//! use embedded_io_adapters::std::FromStd;
//! use std::io::Cursor;
//!
//! let data = [0x0F, /* ... SBUS frame data ... */ 0x00];
//! let cursor = Cursor::new(data);
//! let mut parser = SbusParser::new(FromStd::new(cursor));
//!
//! match parser.read_frame() {
//!     Ok(packet) => {
//!         println!("Channel 1 value: {}", packet.channels[0]);
//!         if packet.flags.failsafe {
//!             println!("Failsafe active!");
//!         }
//!     }
//!     Err(e) => println!("Error reading frame: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Protocol Details
//!
//! SBUS frames are 25 bytes long with the following structure:
//! - Start byte (0x0F)
//! - 22 bytes of channel data (16 channels, 11 bits each)
//! - 1 byte of flags
//! - End byte (0x00)
